# platt_code_sample_app
An additional page was implemented that attempts to find the most average Star Wars film based on film data. The calculation for this is based on nothing except my own wish to see how certain data structures are handled in C# compared to Perl which I currently use for web development.

Also, I ran into an issue when testing if this would download and open correctly for someone else - I needed to rebuild the solution in order to get this to run. Thought I'd mention in case this issue occurs on other machines!
